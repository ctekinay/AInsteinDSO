# Claude Coding Agent Instructions - AInstein Alliander AI Assistant

## Project Context
You are working with AInstein, an advanced Enterprise Architecture AI Assistant for Alliander, a Dutch Distribution System Operator (DSO). This system provides intelligent assistance for enterprise architecture consulting in the energy sector, featuring multi-LLM architecture, comprehensive knowledge graphs, homonym disambiguation, and real-time web interface for ArchiMate modeling and TOGAF compliance.

## Critical Requirements

### 1. GROUNDING IS MANDATORY
- **NEVER** generate a response without citations
- Every response MUST include at least one of: `archi:id-`, `skos:`, `iec:`, `togaf:adm:`, `entsoe:`, `lido:`
- If you cannot ground a response, raise `UngroundedReplyError` - do not guess

### 2. Knowledge Sources (in priority order)
1. **energy_knowledge_graph.ttl** - 39,100+ triples with IEC, ENTSOE, EUR-LEX terms
2. **ArchiMate models** - XML files in data/models/
3. **TOGAF patterns** - Indexed separately in togaf_core RAG
4. **Only use vectors as last resort** - Structured data first, always

### 3. Current Architecture Principles
- **4R+G+C Pipeline**: Reflect â†’ Route â†’ Retrieve â†’ Refine â†’ Ground â†’ Critic â†’ Validate
- **Multi-LLM orchestration**: Primary Groq, fallback OpenAI, local Ollama support
- **Embedding-first retrieval**: Vector similarity with homonym disambiguation
- **Citation authenticity**: Pre-loaded citation pools prevent fake citations
- **Session persistence**: Conversation state and audit trail management
- **Human review triggers**: Automatic when confidence < 0.75
- **Real-time web interface**: FastAPI with trace visualization

```

## Code Standards

### Python Requirements
- Python 3.11+
- Type hints on ALL functions
- Docstrings with parameter descriptions
- Async/await for I/O operations
- Comprehensive error handling with specific exceptions

### Testing Requirements
- Every module must have corresponding tests
- Integration tests for full pipeline
- Mock external dependencies in unit tests
- Test coverage > 80%

### Critical Classes to Implement

1. **GroundingCheck** (src/safety/grounding.py)
   - Must validate ALL responses have citations
   - Suggest citations if missing
   - Raise exception if cannot ground

2. **QueryRouter** (src/routing/query_router.py)
   - Check domain terms FIRST
   - Route to: structured_model | togaf_method | unstructured_docs
   - Load vocabularies from config/

3. **Critic** (src/validation/critic.py)
   - Rank top-3 suggestions
   - Mark irrelevant items (max 18%)
   - Force human review if confidence < 0.75

4. **ProductionEAAgent** (src/agent/ea_assistant.py)
   - Implement full pipeline
   - Store audit trail in context_store
   - Generate PR drafts for changes

## Quality Gates (MUST PASS)
- **Grounding failures**: 0 (absolutely no ungrounded responses)
- **Top-1 accuracy**: â‰¥ 80%
- **Abstention rate**: â‰¥ 15% (good to abstain when uncertain)
- **Response time**: < 3 seconds
- **All model changes**: via PR only

## Domain Vocabulary Samples

### IEC Terms to Recognize
- ActivePower, ReactivePower, Equipment
- Conductor, Breaker, Transformer
- IEC 61968, IEC 61970, CIM

### ArchiMate Elements
- Business: Actor, Role, Process, Service, Capability
- Application: Component, Service, Interface
- Technology: Node, Device, System Software

### TOGAF ADM Phases
- Phase A: Architecture Vision
- Phase B: Business Architecture â†’ Business Layer elements
- Phase C: Information Systems â†’ Application/Data elements
- Phase D: Technology Architecture â†’ Technology Layer elements

## Example Patterns

### Good Citation Example
```python
response = "Based on TOGAF Phase B (togaf:adm:B), use Business Capability (archi:id-cap-001) for modeling grid congestion per IEC 61968 (iec:GridCongestion)."
# Has multiple citations âœ“
```

### Bad Response Example
```python
response = "You should use a Business Capability for this."
# NO CITATIONS - Must raise UngroundedReplyError âœ—
```

## Special Instructions

### When Creating Tests
Always include these test cases:
1. Electronic Court Filing â†’ Capability (from research paper)
2. Grid congestion management (energy domain specific)
3. Query without possible grounding (should abstain)

### When Implementing Router
Priority order:
1. Check for IEC/energy terms â†’ structured_model
2. Check for TOGAF/ArchiMate terms â†’ togaf_method  
3. Default â†’ unstructured_docs

### When Generating PR Drafts
Include:
- Branch name: `ea-assist-{session_id[:8]}`
- jArchi script for changes
- Diff preview
- Citations for why changes are needed

## Performance Targets
- Knowledge graph load: < 3000ms (realistic for 39K triples)
- SPARQL query: < 1500ms P95 (with 35,000x cache speedup)
- Full pipeline: < 3s P50
- Router decision: < 50ms

## Error Messages
- UngroundedReplyError: "Response lacks required citations. Must include at least one of: {prefixes}"
- LowConfidenceError: "Confidence {score} below threshold. Human review required."
- InvalidModelChangeError: "Model changes must be submitted via PR, not direct modification."

## Remember
1. **Grounding is not optional** - it's the #1 requirement
2. **Structured data beats embeddings** - always check KG first
3. **When in doubt, abstain** - better to request human review than give wrong answer
4. **Every decision is audited** - context_store tracks everything

## Git Workflow Instructions

### Commit Strategy
- **Commit after EVERY completed component** (not just at the end)
- **Run tests before committing** - never commit broken code
- **Use conventional commits** format (see below)
- **Push to feature branch**, not main directly

### Commit Message Format
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature implementation
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `test`: Adding tests
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes nor adds feature
- `chore`: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

Examples:
```
feat(grounding): implement citation validation with UngroundedReplyError

- Add GroundingCheck class with assert_citations method
- Implement citation pattern matching for all required prefixes
- Add auto-suggestion for missing citations
- Comprehensive test coverage for grounding scenarios

Refs: claude.md requirements section
```

### Git Commands to Execute

After creating each module:
```bash
# Run tests first
pytest tests/test_<module>.py -v

# If tests pass, stage changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat(<module>): <what you implemented>"

# Push to feature branch
git push origin feat/ea-assistant-implementation
```

### Branch Strategy
- Main branch: `main` (protected)
- Feature branch: `feat/ea-assistant-implementation`
- PR will be created after all quality gates pass

### Automated Commit Points
1. After project structure creation â†’ `chore(setup): initialize project structure with Poetry`
2. After KG loader â†’ `feat(knowledge): implement knowledge graph loader with validation`
3. After grounding â†’ `feat(safety): add grounding check with citation enforcement`
4. After router â†’ `feat(routing): implement query router with domain term detection`
5. After critic â†’ `feat(validation): add critic module with confidence assessment`
6. After ArchiMate parser â†’ `feat(archimate): implement model parser with TOGAF mapping`
7. After main pipeline â†’ `feat(agent): integrate full 4R+G+C pipeline`
8. After API â†’ `feat(api): add FastAPI endpoints with async handling`
9. After evaluation â†’ `feat(evaluation): implement quality gate harness`
10. After documentation â†’ `docs: complete README and ADRs`
